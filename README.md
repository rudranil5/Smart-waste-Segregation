  <H1>A System to recognize and separate waste types</H1>
  <br>
  users... never worry anymore, just throw the waste in the bin, rest on Us . WE are here to squeeze our minds.
  <I> <H3>THIS PROJECT WAS PRESENTED AT SMART BENGAL HACKATHON 2025 , CONSISTING OF TRAINED MACHINE LEARNING  MODELS FOR OBJECT TYPE DETECTION,  AND VARIOUS SENSORS TO DETECT OBJECT AND FURTHER CLASSIFY THEM, ALSO CHECK THE BIN'S STATUS TIME TO TIME. OUR GROUP IS STILL WORKING ON FIXING ITS BUGS & IMPROVING IT. I GAINED VALUABLE EXPERIENCES AND INSIGHTS  LEADING MY OUR TEAM AND WORKING  ON THIS PROJECT. THIS NEEDED A LOT OF PRIOR RESEARCH, AND IDEA GENERATION KEEPING IN MIND REAL WORLD APPLICATION.</H3></I>
